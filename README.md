# Usage

Watch ``Source.cpp``.

```cpp
const std::vector<std::wstring> result = html_extract(L"sample.html", L"div.inner");
```

call ``html_extract`` like this.
First argument is filename to analyse. specify relative path from current directory.
Secound argument is search key. The format is same as css's selector(element selector, id selector, class selector only).

Don't forget to call ``std::wcout.imbue`` before call ``html_extract``.

Thank you.
